HackWeek
--------
A tool to nurture hack ideas into projects and then collaborate on them. It's used 
during [SUSEs hackweek](http://hackweek.suse.com), a week where SUSE engineers can
experiment without limits and get their opportunity to innovate, collaborate across teams,
and learn.

## Features
* Admins can add hackweeks
* Users ceate ideas for a hackweek
* Users can like and comment on ideas
* Users can join ideas turning them into projects
* Users can supplement projects with files, links, agenda items and "needs"
* Users can supplement themselves with "haves"
* Ideas/Projects "needs" are matched to Users "haves"
* Admins can rate project results

## Hack it
* [Fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
* Configure the rails app
```shell
cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
cp config/application.yml.example config/application.yml
cp config/secrets.yml.example config/secrets.yml
```
* Install the ruby gem bundle
```shell
bundle install
```
* Create the database
```shell
rake db:setup
```
* Create Sphinx configuration, start the search daemon and index existing DB contents
```shell
rake ts:regenerate ts:index
```
* Run the rails server
```shell
rails server
```
* Open http://0.0.0.0:3000 in your browser
* [Start hacking](http://railsforzombies.org/)
* [Test your changes](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/docs)
```shell
rspec spec
```
* [Send pull requesst](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)

## Resources
* Design mockups of the rails app are in the design directory.
* The project list for HackWeek9 is in the [Wiki](http://github.com/SUSE/hackweek/wiki).
* There are some tools in the tool directory.
* Data of past hackweeks is in the archive directory.
* The source of the [old webpage](http://suse.github.io/hackweek/) is in the gh-pages branch.

## Requirements
Sphinx (searchd) should be installed. No need to configure and launch it separately, everything will be taken care of with `rake ts:regenerate`.

Mysql/mariadb should be installed and service should be running. If you have non-empty superadmin(root) password for the DB, you need to specify the same in config/database.yml

If you want to send mails on addition of a comment, please refer config/application.yml and do the configurations.


# Development with Vagrant

As our project involves somewhat complicated setup (MySQL and Shpinx search) even for development environment, we've created Vagrantfile to get you up and running.

1. Install Virtualbox (can be found in your OS package manager or [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)).
2. Download and install the [latest vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).
3. Install vagrant-exec plugin: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-exec`.
4. Start Vagrant box: `vagrant up`. It will set up and start an OpenSUSE 13.2 VirtualBox VM in the background. 
VM will have an autosynced folder `/vagrant` with your code, and can always be shut down with `vagrant halt` and removed with `vagrant destroy`.
5. Remote connection to the Vagrant box is available with `vagrant ssh`, one can run single-shot remote commands like `vagrant exec rake db:migrate` (will be run in the context of `/vagrant` folder; no need to additionaly state `bundle exec`).
6. Install missing gems: `vagrant exec bundle`.
7. Migrate development database: `vagrant exec rake db:migrate`.
8. Launch the application: `vagrant exec rails s`. It should be accessible at http://localhost:3000, as usual.
